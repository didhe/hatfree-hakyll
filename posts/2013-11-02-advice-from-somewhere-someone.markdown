title: Advice from somewhere, someone

I do not, customarily, consider advice provided. As a statement of what is
right and good, advice must rightly emerge from a framework of what is right
and good. Within such a model, the very best advice---that advice which is
always right---is tautology; a piece of advice which adheres to a system of
values which has already been accepted *cannot* have been provided, because
it already was, inherent to those values. This sort of advice was already
knewn; one simply hadn't been practicing it to as full an extent---receiving
the advice was perhaps helpful, but more in the way of nagging reminder than
profound revelation.

I cannot say much for profound revelations---possibly, but not necessarily,
because I haven't achieved any, or perhaps because I don't remember and
recognise any. Still, it is so apocalyptic advice, if to a lesser extent,
which might be considered advice which *can* be provided: advice which is
*not* in every case in accord with one's priors. Advice which is *provided*
must be advice which introduces a new aspect into (or overturns altogether,
though mere advice which does this much seems rare) one's judgment of what
is good and right.

Now, if a certain Stephen Crane of the nineteenth century happens to have
written, and published in a collection (*War is Kind and, and Other Lines*)
a brief poem, reproduced below:

> A man said to the universe: \ "Sir I exist!" \ "However," replied the
> universe, \ "The fact has not created in me \ "A sense of obligation."

---then, shall we say that this advice, or at least the sentiment, was
provided to me Stephen Crane himself?

There are at least three quite distinct elements in this story, which are to
great extent separated in continuity but united by an overarching theme.

Of the formers, one first intersects with our third fully three years ago,
with a contemporary schoolteacher's and its declaration. The former is
Thomas Jacobs, and the latter is, variously, "I don't care how you feel," "I
don't care about your feelings," "I don't care about student [*sic*]." (This
latter has been accompanied by "I care about students," which tends to be
contextually the implication of the the formers as well.)

A second is an introduction to the Stephen Crane cited above, in the form of
handout distributed by Marissa Smith, closer to two years ago, a piece of
American literature.

A third comes as parts of the closing lines of two different translations of
Albert Camus' *L'Ã‰tranger* (*The Stranger*), the Matthew Ward and the Stuart
Gilbert, distributed by the same, as the same piece of world literature.
Respectively, they read:

> As if the blind rage had washed me clean, rid me of hope; for the first
> time, in that night alive with signs and stars, I opened myself to the
> gentle indifference of the world.

> It was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of
> hope, and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars,
> for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign
> indifference of the universe.

Shall we consider this three items of advice? Or shall we, rather, consider
this a single item of advice---and then, which did it come from---if any?

Perhaps a better question would ask whether this is good advice.

I consider this in whole to be a single item of good advice. That is to say,
this sentiment, conveyed to me by three paths, contributes to a single whole
which agrees in large part with my definition of value, of what is right and
what is good. It has been, or it has become, or it has been incorporated
into, a defining element of my *Weltanschauung*.

I would not say it has done me any favours in suggesting courses of action;
perhaps even very much the opposite. But it has provided me with a framework
in which to accomodate reality. An uncaring world of uncaring others driven
by uncaring phenomena is a world with plenty of room for pleasant things. It
is a pleasantly simple world of itself.
