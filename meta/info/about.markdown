title: About

This blog is maintained by Michael Zuo and runs on [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), partly because Hakyll is excellent, but mostly because I find it fun to tinker with. It is, in any case, significantly more configurable than, say, Blogger or an Edublogs Wordpress blog, and its configuration more frequently presents, to me, interesting problems rather than obnoxious obstacles.

This is a static blog, and an unfortunate consequence of this is that it thus *can't* natively support comments. But since comments are so important to the blog medium, external support is integrated: the comments are (perhaps unfortunately) powered by [Disqus](http://disqus.com/). They could, perhaps, be integrated more effectively, of course.

If some other critically important feature is missing, I should be able to implement it; I've implemented only everything I consider to be important for a blog.
