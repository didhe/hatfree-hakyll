title: About
---

This blog runs on [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), partially because
Hakyll is excellent, but mostly because I find it fun to tinker with. It is,
in any case, infinitely more configurable than, say, Blogger or an Edublogs
Wordpress blog.

This is a static blog. The comments are (perhaps sadly) powered by
[Disqus](http://disqus.com/).

If some critically important feature is missing, that can usually be added,
but I've implemented everything I consider to be important for a blog.
